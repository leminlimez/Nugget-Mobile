# the sneakyf1shy apple intelligence tutorial v2.0

> [!WARNING]
> This is **patched** as of iOS/iPadOS 18.1 DevBeta 5. If you want to follow this, **stay on Beta 4**.


#### This actually downloads the models, and is NOT just new SiriUI. Hence, this process is complex and **probably not worth it.**

### ⚠️ Prepare to be disappointed and annoyed, and have your time wasted! ⚠️
- What does **not** work: Writing Tools, Memories, Reduce Interruptions, Image Eraser and other tools that are within official Apple Intelligence on supported devices.
- What does work: Slightly better Siri, New UI
  - (e.g) You can ask about the iPhone/iPad User Guide, or ask to play a specific song in Spotify, which Old Siri could not do.

**⚠️ Small preface note**
- 🧱 This will also _temporarily_ brick your Face ID (fixable, see [Fixing Face ID](#Part-4-Fixing-Face-ID))
- 📺 This _may_ also have some connection to breaking standby/AOD (_**not** confirmed_).

### 🚧 Always, only try this at your own risk 🚧
Modifying your device's MobileGestalt **has a small risk of bricking your device,** if done wrong.

### Again, if you _just_ want the new UI, this is **NOT** the tutorial you're looking for.

### So, what does this do?
To get  Intelligence on older models:
- Generative Model capability has to be added to MobileGestalt
- Eligibility (regional ability, and also the "waitlist") for  Intelligence has to pass/be bypassed
- Your iPhone model has to be temporarily spoofed to a newer model (e.g. 15 Pro) that is capable of  Intelligence, so that Apple servers let you download the model

Once the models are downloaded, undoing the spoofing keeps it working. It behaves as if the phone had always supported  Intelligence.
But, to download these models, you first need to change your ProductType to 15 Pro or newer, wait for it to download, then revert the changes.

This is going to be a multi-stage process, with some trial and error. It doesn't always consistently initiate the download.


### Part 0: Requirements
Your device must be an iPhone XS or newer, on **iOS/iPadOS 18.1 Beta 4 / 18.1 Public Beta** (or newer?)

### Part 1: Gestalt modification
- Grab a fresh .plist copy of your MobileGestalt file using the [shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e2077174cc424253a24164a1df674ac4).
- Make a backup copy somewhere! You **will** need this later, and if you want to revert this tweak.
- Every time you apply **any** changes to your phone, such as updating it, **run the shortcut again, and import/use the new MobileGestalt file instead.**

**Spoof your ProductType (Device Model)**

Open the .plist file with ANY file editor, use CTRL + F to find `h9jDsbgj7xIVeIQ8S3/X3Q`. You should find the line with your iPhone/iPad model identifer under it. (Example: `iPhone14,2`).

Replace it with `iPhone16,2` (OR `iPad16,3` IF YOU ARE ON iPad) so the line should look something like this: `<string>iPhone16,2</string>`.

This will allow you to spoof Apple's servers into thinking you have an iPhone 15 Pro (or well iPad Pro M4), which enables you to download the models, but also is what will break Face ID temporarily (due to part seralisation.)

**Add the Generative Model capability**

Now, after this line in the file:
```xml
<key>CacheExtra</key>
  <dict>
```
**add** these 2 lines (the indentation does not matter)
```xml
<key>A62OafQ85EJAiiqKn4agtg</key>
<integer>1</integer>
```

Now, go to **Nugget** and apply the modified MobileGestalt .plist file to your device, then reboot.
> MobileGestalt File path: `/var/containers/Shared/SystemGroup/systemgroup.com.apple.mobilegestaltcache/Library/Caches/com.apple.MobileGestalt.plist`



### Part 2: Bypass the "Waitlist" / Eligibility
> If you are in China, or don't see it after lots of trying, look at the [Regional Requirements](#extra-regional-requirements) section
You should now have the Apple Intelligence tab appear in Settings on your device.

If so, go to MisakaX then add the modified MobileGestalt .plist file then click on "Apple Intelligence (Extra)"

> If it doesn't work, using the file attached to the end of this guide (scroll down `eligibility.plist`), go to Nugget, or Misaka and write the file to path `/var/db/eligibilityd/eligibility.plist` on your device.

You _may_ have to repeat this step if you don't see the intelligence tab.

### Part 3: Hope it works
- Reboot your device, ensure you're connected to Wi-Fi and disable Low Battery Mode.
- Then, wait upto 5 minutes to let the phone fully boot up, then close the Settings App then reopen it.
- Ensure your device's region is set to the US, and the language is US English.
- Ensure your Apple ID is NOT an EU account, if it is then just sign out of iCloud entirely. If still not working, redo step 2, and or make a non-EU apple ID.

_Inside Apple Intelligence & Siri page:_
- Ensure your Apple Intelligence language is set to `English: United States`

> If you do not have have the green/grey toggle next to "Apple Intelligence"
> Wait for it to "download" for upto 15 minutes, if not then repeat step 2 and reboot.

- Turn the Apple Intelligence toggle **off**, then back **on again**, then wait for it to download the models and install.
- Indicators it's working:
    - If your phone gets very very hot
    - In settings > General > iPhone/iPad Storage > (scroll down) iOS, there should be "Apple Intelligence", growing from 44MB to until around 2.2GB-3GB (can vary).
- If not working, you can try changing your Apple Intelligence language to something random, then wait a minute, then change it back to `English: United States`, then try again.

### Part 4: Fixing Face ID?
- You must **wait** for it Apple Intelligence (Siri) to be fully downloaded and working, **before** fixing Face ID/reverting your ProductType.
- Get your **modified** MobileGestalt file from Part 1 (not the backup you made)
- Change ProductType key (`h9jDsbgj7xIVeIQ8S3/X3Q`) back to the correct one for your device (e.g. `iPhone14,2` or `iPad12,1`)
    - Find out at https://appledb.dev/device-selection/ if you've forgotten
    - By "back from part 1", you essentially need to keep the key `DeviceSupportsGenerativeModelSystems`
- Now apply this new MobileGestalt file back to your device with Nugget.
- Reboot your device, connect to Wi-Fi
- Then, wait like 5 minutes again.
- It should do some "downloading" for like upto 5 minutes, then the AI (Siri) should start working again!

### Extra: Regional Requirements
- If you get the AI option in Settings, but it disappears quickly, enable and apply the "Disable Regional Restrictions" option in Nugget.
- If you are in China, first use the "Disable Shutter Sound" in MisakaX. This changes the device from Asia to Europe/USA, which should help with trying to get Apple Intelligence to work properly.

### Extra: Other Information
- I mean basically ensure your gestalt does not have internal storage thing...this might have broken it for me for a while (no evidence though)
- You can also mess with feature flags, such as PrivateCloudCompute, TextComposer, Siri, SiriNL, etc
